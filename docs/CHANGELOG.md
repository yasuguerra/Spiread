# Changelog - Game Fixes

## Overview
This update addresses 5 critical issues in Spiread's mini-games to improve functionality and mobile user experience.

## Changes by Module

### 1. Twin Words Game (`components/games/TwinWordsGrid.jsx`)
**Problem**: Showed unrelated words instead of truly similar/confusable pairs.

**Changes**:
- **New confusable pairs system**: Created `lib/words-es.ts` with curated Spanish word pairs in categories:
  - Accent variants: `esta/está`, `mas/más`, `médico/medico`
  - Look-alike glyphs: `amor/arnor`, `claro/daro`, `tiempo/tiernpo`
  - Minimal pairs: `casa/caza`, `peso/piso`, `perro/perno`
  - Case differences: `CASA/casa`, `Mundo/mundo`
- **Adaptive difficulty**: 
  - Difficulty increases after 3 consecutive correct pairs
  - 5 difficulty levels with increasingly subtle differences
  - Difficulty decreases on poor performance (<80% accuracy)
- **Enhanced scoring**: Now shows current difficulty level instead of arbitrary percentage

**API**:
```javascript
import { getConfusablePairs, areWordsIdentical } from '@/lib/words-es'
// Returns pairs based on difficulty level and identical ratio
const pairs = getConfusablePairs(level, count, identicalRatio)
```

### 2. Par/Impar Game (`components/games/ParImpar.jsx`)
**Problem**: Poor mobile UX with small numbers and rightward grid shift.

**Changes**:
- **Responsive grid container**:
  - Centered with `max-w-sm mx-auto`
  - Fixed 4-column grid with `gap-2 sm:gap-3`
  - Responsive font sizing: `clamp(18px, 4vw, 24px)`
- **Touch-optimized buttons**:
  - Minimum 44×44px touch targets
  - `touch-manipulation` CSS property
  - Disabled tap highlight: `WebkitTapHighlightColor: transparent`
- **Layout stability**:
  - Pre-measured grid dimensions prevent layout shift
  - Consistent padding: `p-2 sm:p-4`
  - Reduced min-height on mobile: `min-h-[300px] sm:min-h-[400px]`

### 3. Letters Grid Game (`components/games/LettersGrid.jsx`)
**Problem**: Never started, stuck on "preparando el juego".

**Changes**:
- **Robust initialization**:
  - Added `preparing` state with 300ms timeout fallback
  - Immediate state transition to prevent infinite loading
  - Error handling with graceful degradation
- **State management**:
  - New `isInitialized` flag ensures one-time setup
  - Loading spinner with clear user feedback
  - Automatic progression to playable state
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Loading animation during initialization
  - Clear "Comenzar Juego" button when ready

### 4. Anagrams Game (`components/games/Anagrams.jsx`)
**Problem**: Difficulty never increased after correct answers.

**Changes**:
- **3-up/1-down staircase algorithm**:
  - Track consecutive correct answers with `streakCount`
  - Increase difficulty after 3 correct: word length (4→5→6→7→8)
  - Secondary parameter: reduce time limit when max length reached
  - Decrease difficulty on wrong answers (step down)
- **Adaptive parameters**:
  - Primary: Word length progression
  - Secondary: Time per word (10s → 4s minimum)
  - Difficulty persists throughout session
- **Enhanced scoring**: Show maximum difficulty reached in session

**Difficulty Progression**:
```
Level 1: 4 letters, 10s → Level 2: 5 letters, 10s → ... → Level 5: 8 letters, 4s
```

### 5. Word Search Game (`components/games/WordSearch.jsx`)
**Problem**: Hard to drag on mobile devices.

**Changes**:
- **Tap-to-find mode**:
  - Auto-detects mobile viewports (`window.innerWidth <= 768`)
  - Pre-computed cell-to-word mapping for instant lookup
  - Single tap marks unique words immediately
  - Two-tap disambiguation for overlapping words
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Blue highlight for cells containing unfound words
  - Yellow highlight for pending disambiguation
  - Green highlight for found word cells
  - Hover effects on mobile
- **Disambiguation logic**:
  - First tap: sets pending state (3s timeout)
  - Second tap on same cell: cycles through available words
  - Clear visual indicators for user guidance

**How to Toggle Tap-to-Find**:
- **Automatic**: Enabled on viewports ≤768px or touch devices
- **Manual**: Can be toggled via the `tapMode` state (future enhancement)

## Technical Improvements

### New Utility Functions
- `lib/words-es.ts`: Spanish confusable word pairs with difficulty categorization
- Cell-to-word mapping for instant word lookup in Word Search
- Robust error handling with timeout fallbacks
- Enhanced mobile detection and responsive design

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for interactive game elements
- Keyboard navigation support maintained
- Screen reader friendly state announcements
- Touch target size compliance (44×44px minimum)

### Performance
- Efficient cell mapping reduces lookup complexity from O(n) to O(1)
- Pre-computed word positions eliminate real-time calculations
- Debounced state updates prevent excessive re-renders
- Optimized grid rendering with proper key props

### Mobile UX
- Responsive typography with `clamp()` functions
- Safe area handling for notched devices
- Prevent unwanted zoom on input focus
- Optimized touch event handling

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Jest)
- Twin word pair generation and categorization
- Anagram text normalization (`más` ≅ `mas`)
- Difficulty staircase logic (3-up/1-down)
- Word Search cell-to-word mapping

### E2E Tests (Cypress)
- Mobile viewport testing for Par/Impar and Word Search
- Tap-to-find functionality verification
- Difficulty progression in Anagrams and Twin Words
- Letters Grid initialization within time budget

## Compatibility
- **Browsers**: Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- **Devices**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile (tested on viewports 320px+)
- **Touch**: Full touch and pointer event support
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant interactive elements

## Future Enhancements
- Manual tap mode toggle for Word Search
- Additional confusable pair categories (numbers, symbols)
- Difficulty progression persistence across sessions
- Advanced mobile gestures (swipe, pinch)
- Voice control integration for accessibility

---

**Definition of Done**: ✅ All acceptance criteria satisfied, no console errors, responsive design working on mobile, adaptive difficulty functioning, tap-to-find operational.
