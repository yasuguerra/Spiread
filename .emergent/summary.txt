The AI engineer successfully built the Campayo Spreeder Pro application, subsequently rebranded to Spiread, from initial requirements through two major development sprints. The first sprint focused on the core RSVP reader and onboarding flow, including initial Supabase integration. The second, more extensive sprint, implemented a comprehensive game architecture, an adaptive difficulty engine, four new Campayo-style training games (Shuttle Table, Twin Words, Par/Impar, Memory Digits), and an advanced session scheduler. All related backend APIs for game runs and session schedules were developed and tested. The core work for the MVP as defined across these two sprints appears complete. The final step remaining for full functionality and persistence is the user's manual execution of provided SQL scripts in Supabase, after which the AI engineer is awaiting direction for the next development module.

The user requested a speed reading web application, Campayo Spreeder Pro (later rebranded to Spiread), combining Ramón Campayo's techniques with an RSVP reader. The core goal is to multiply reading speed (WPM) and comprehension via gamified daily training and an intelligent RSVP reader. The initial MVP roadmap focused on Sprint 1: Core RSVP + On-Boarding, and Sprint 2: Campayo Module + Metrics.

Key features include:
- **On-Boarding & Initial Test**: Measure WPM and comprehension, save baseline.
- **Speed Reader (RSVP)**: Fine control (WPM, chunk size), 4 modes, import TXT/PDF/EPUB, in-app dictionary, dark mode, cloud progress.
- **Campayo Training**: Expand visual field (side-bars, curtain), reduce subvocalization (metronome), diagonal reading, Flash-Words, numerical visualization, 1-25 board, Skimming. Adaptive difficulty.
- **Gamification & Metrics**: Levels, streaks, medals, ranking, WPM vs Comprehension dashboard.
- **Library & Content**: Cloud library, browser extensions, video courses.
- **Accessibility & UX**: Keyboard navigation, contrasts, dyslexia mode, responsive, PWA.
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui, Zustand. Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage). Web Workers, Service Worker, Chart.js, i18n (es/en). Vercel deploy.
- **Monetization**: Freemium (300 WPM limit), Pro plan (unlimited, analytics, export) via Stripe.
- **AI/LLM**: Emergent LLM Key (default OpenAI), for on-demand summaries and comprehension questions with caching.
- **Database Schema (Initial)**: , , , .
- **Database Schema (Extended)**: , , , , , , , with RLS.
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright, CI with GitHub Actions, seed data.

The project has transitioned through Sprint 1 (Core RSVP + On-Boarding) and Sprint 2 (Rebranding, Common Game Architecture, Adaptive Difficulty, 4 new Campayo Games, Scheduler, API extension), with the core functional logic now implemented.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major refactoring and feature implementation sprint. The application, initially Campayo Spreeder Pro, has been fully rebranded to **Spiread**, with all UI and metadata updated.

The primary focus of this completed sprint was to establish a robust **common architecture for training games** using a  component, which handles shared states (idle, playing, paused, summary), keyboard shortcuts (Space, ←/→, Esc), and auto-pauses when the browser tab loses focus for more than 2 seconds. This  integrates with a new **adaptive difficulty engine** based on a scientifically validated 3-down/1-up staircase algorithm, which automatically adjusts game parameters (e.g., grid size, exposure time, inter-stimulus interval) to maintain user engagement and optimal challenge.

Four new **Campayo-style training games** have been implemented:
1.  **Shuttle Table (Schulte)**: Continuous mode with adaptive grid sizes (3x3 to 7x7), supporting both grid and dispersed layouts, points, and streak multipliers.
2.  **Twin Words (Grid by Screen)**: Displays multiple pairs of words per screen, where the user identifies micro-differences (e.g., accents, subtle transpositions). Features an adaptive timer and rich dataset of confusables.
3.  **Par/Impar (Go/No-Go)**: A speed-based binary decision game where users identify numbers as even or odd. It features an adaptively decreasing inter-stimulus interval (ISI).
4.  **Recuerda el Número (Memory Digits)**: A memory game where users recall adaptively increasing lengths of digit sequences after a brief exposure.

A **Session Scheduler** ( component) has been implemented to orchestrate predefined training sessions (15min, 30min, 60min templates) that sequence these new games automatically. Each completed game block and full session is designed for persistence.

The **backend APIs** ( and ) have been extended to support the storage of individual game results and complete session histories, including detailed JSONB metrics for each game type and adaptive difficulty levels. All changes include robust validation, CORS headers, and error handling.

The Supabase schema () has been updated with the new tables (, , ) and RLS policies. The application frontend is fully functional with these new modules.

The immediate remaining action is for the user to manually execute the  script in their Supabase SQL Editor to enable full data persistence, as the AI engineer cannot directly execute SQL on the user's Supabase instance.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Reiterate the options presented for the next development module, pending user confirmation and the manual execution of the Supabase SQL script for data persistence.
