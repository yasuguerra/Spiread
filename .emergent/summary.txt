The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Spiread application from MVP to an MVP+ state, completing several complex development phases. Initially, core RSVP reader and Campayo training games were built. Subsequently, Sprint A introduced AI/LLM features (summarization, question generation with caching and quotas) and foundational gamification (XP, level, streaks, achievements). A hotfix for  was also addressed.

The current comprehensive MVP+ Closure Sprint was broken into five phases. The engineer completed Phase 1 (Foundation & DB Alignment), Phase 2 (AI Questions System hardening and UI integration), Phase 3 (implementation of four new Campayo games: Running Words, Letters Grid, Word Search, Anagrams, including seed generation and basic integration), and Phase 4 (full gamification logic for XP, levels, streaks, and achievements, with associated UI components and StatsPanel integration). Finally, Phase 5 (Session Runner 2.0, i18n, a11y, PWA setup) was also completed structurally.

Throughout these phases, the engineer encountered and resolved various issues, including  path resolution, build errors, and minor database naming inconsistencies during backend testing. The engineer is now tasked with addressing a specific frontend display issue where the newly implemented Phase 3 games are not correctly listed in the Entrenamiento Cerebral section of the application UI. The previous engineer consistently logged linting errors but proceeded, indicating a focus on core functionality delivery.

<product_requirements>
Spiread is a web application designed to enhance reading speed and comprehension using Ram√≥n Campayo's methods and an RSVP reader. The core problem it addresses is improving reading efficiency through gamified daily training. Key features include: an onboarding WPM test, a customizable RSVP reader, Campayo training modules with adaptive difficulty, AI/LLM integration (summaries, comprehension questions with cache/quotas via Emergent LLM Key), comprehensive gamification (XP/Level, Streaks, detailed Achievements), and advanced training games (Running Words, Letters Grid, Word Search, Anagrams) with precise 60-second timers and adaptive difficulty. Persistence uses , , and  for game resume. The application leverages Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn-ui, Zustand, and Supabase. Initial MVP completed core RSVP and Campayo modules. Recent requirements include AI/LLM integration, comprehensive gamification, additional advanced training games, session runner with templates, i18n (es/en), accessibility, and PWA capabilities. The product aims for a freemium model.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the MVP+ Closure Sprint, which encompassed five significant phases of development for the Spiread application.

**Phase 1 (Foundation & DB Alignment)** was successfully completed, involving updates to  for new columns (, ) and Row Level Security, creation of  for consistent data casing between frontend and Supabase, and implementation of new backend API endpoints for user progress (, ) and AI service health ().

**Phase 2 (AI Questions System)** focused on hardening the  endpoint. This involved implementing strict schema validation (using Zod), monthly token quotas, a robust caching system using SHA256 hashing, and text normalization for accurate evidence indexing in comprehension questions. The  component was updated to reflect these AI features on the UI. A critical build error related to missing  path aliases was identified and resolved during this phase. Backend testing confirmed the successful implementation and functionality of all Phase 2 requirements for the AI questions API.

**Phase 3 (New Games)** involved the creation and initial integration of four new Campayo-style training games: Running Words, Letters Grid, Word Search, and Anagrams. A  script was developed to generate necessary game content. A  component was introduced to standardize integration of these new games with the existing . While the structural integration within  to manage these games was performed, the user's latest feedback indicates that these new games are not yet fully visible as distinct cards on the Entrenamiento Cerebral frontend page.

**Phase 4 (Complete Gamification)** saw the extensive implementation of gamification logic. This included updating  to handle XP and level calculations, daily streak management, and a comprehensive set of achievements (both existing and new game-specific ones). New UI components like  (for displaying XP/Level/Streak in the header) and  (for level-up and achievement notifications) were created. The  was enhanced to visualize historical game scores using . The backend logic for all gamification features was successfully implemented and tested.

**Phase 5 (Session Runner 2.0, i18n/a11y, PWA)** involved the foundational setup for advanced features.  was created as the core component for structured training sessions. An internationalization (i18n) system was established with dedicated language files (, ) and a . Accessibility (a11y) features were initiated with a  hook and  updates. Furthermore, the application was set up as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with the creation of  and  (service worker) files. Backend testing confirmed the i18n and session persistence logic, and minor database table naming inconsistencies were resolved.

The current immediate task, as per the user's latest request, is to address the frontend display issue where the Entrenamiento Cerebral page currently only shows 5 out of the 9 total implemented games, implying the new Phase 3 games are not yet properly presented in the UI's game listing.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to modify  to correctly import and render UI cards for all 9 implemented games on the Entrenamiento Cerebral page.
