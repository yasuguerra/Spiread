The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the Spiread application from MVP to a Release Candidate (RC) stage, systematically addressing complex requirements across several sprints. Initially, the core MVP+ Closure Sprint focused on foundational elements, AI/LLM integration, new Campayo games, comprehensive gamification, and initial i18n/a11y/PWA setup.

A critical hotfix was then prioritized (Phase 1 of Sprint 1), addressing the incorrect display of games in the UI. The engineer quickly identified that  was the correct location for game card rendering, not , and successfully integrated all 9 games, including the newly added Phase 3 games.

Following this, a comprehensive Phase 6 - Sprint 1 was executed, broken down into multiple Pull Requests (PRs). This included implementing automated frontend testing (Playwright, Lighthouse CI), fixing Supabase schema inconsistencies (UUIDs, RLS, gamification tables), documenting infrastructure issues (502 errors), implementing robust security features (CSP, HTTP headers), adding API rate limiting (with Redis/memory fallback), integrating observability with Sentry (including PII scrubbing), and setting up product analytics with a privacy-first, adapter-based approach.

The trajectory concludes with the engineer initiating Sprint 3, focusing on PWA hardening (Service Worker versioning, offline capabilities), SEO, legal pages, accessibility, and final QA before the v1.0.0-rc.1 release. The immediate task at the end was updating the Service Worker and the debug endpoint for PWA status, followed by testing.

<product_requirements>
Spiread is a web application enhancing reading speed and comprehension using Ram√≥n Campayo's methods and an RSVP reader. The primary goal is to improve reading efficiency through gamified daily training. Key features include an onboarding WPM test, a customizable RSVP reader, adaptive difficulty Campayo training modules, and AI/LLM integration for summarization and comprehension questions with caching and quotas.

The application also features comprehensive gamification (XP, Levels, Streaks, Achievements) and advanced training games (Running Words, Letters Grid, Word Search, Anagrams) with 60-second timers and adaptive difficulty. Data persistence uses , , and  for game resume. Recent updates included an enhanced session runner with templates, i18n (es/en), accessibility, and PWA capabilities. The product aims for a freemium model.

Current work progressed through a hotfix for game display, comprehensive automated testing (UI & API), database schema alignment (UUID, RLS, gamification tables), infrastructure documentation, robust security features (CSP, headers), API rate limiting, Sentry for observability (error/performance monitoring, PII scrubbing), and privacy-first product analytics. The final objective is to release a v1.0.0 Release Candidate with full PWA hardening, SEO, legal pages, and final QA.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just started **Sprint 3: PWA-SEO-LEGAL-RC**, which is the final sprint before cutting the Release Candidate . The immediate focus is on **PWA Hardening**.

Specifically, the engineer has performed the following actions:
1.  **Updated the Service Worker ()**: The service worker has been completely rewritten to include  versioning, and implement advanced caching strategies (cache-first for app shell, network-first with fallback for APIs, stale-while-revalidate for recent docs/quiz data). It also includes logic for controlled invalidation of older caches.
2.  **Created the Offline Page ()**: A dedicated page was created to provide a user-friendly experience when the application goes offline.
3.  **Updated the Debug Endpoint ()**: The  API route has been modified to expose detailed PWA status, including ,  status, cache sizes (, , ), and  queue lengths for  and . This endpoint now also correctly integrates  information alongside existing security and rate limit details.

The current state of work is that these files have been modified or created, and the next step is to test the updated debug endpoint to verify the PWA status information is being correctly reported. This is crucial to ensure the PWA hardening efforts are reflected and measurable.
