The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Spiread application from an initial MVP through several complex development sprints. The work started with core RSVP reader and onboarding, followed by a major sprint introducing a common game architecture, an adaptive difficulty engine, four Campayo-style training games (Shuttle Table, Twin Words, Par/Impar, Memory Digits), and a session scheduler with corresponding backend APIs. Subsequently, the engineer embarked on Sprint A implementing AI/LLM features (summarization, question generation with caching and quotas) and basic gamification (XP, level, streaks, achievements). A hotfix for  was also addressed. The current phase is a comprehensive MVP+ Closure Sprint, broken into five phases, aiming to refine existing features, add four new games, complete gamification, and integrate i18n/accessibility. The engineer successfully completed Phase 1 (Foundation & DB Alignment) and is currently in Phase 2 (AI Questions), having fixed a build error and continuing with UI component integration. Frequent linting issues were noted but typically bypassed.

<product_requirements>
The goal is Spiread, a speed reading web application combining Ram√≥n Campayo's techniques with an RSVP reader, aiming to multiply reading speed and comprehension through gamified daily training. Key features include an onboarding WPM test, a customizable RSVP reader (WPM, chunk size, modes, import), Campayo training modules with adaptive difficulty, gamification (levels, streaks, medals, ranking, WPM dashboard), content library, accessibility, and a freemium model. The application leverages Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn-ui, Zustand, and Supabase. Initial MVP completed core RSVP and Campayo modules. Recent requirements include AI/LLM integration (summaries, comprehension questions with cache/quotas via Emergent LLM Key), comprehensive gamification (XP/Level, Streaks, detailed Achievements), and additional advanced training games (Running Words, Letters Grid, Word Search, Anagrams) with precise 60-second timers and adaptive difficulty. Persistence uses , , and  for game resume.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in **Phase 2 of the MVP+ Closure Sprint**. Prior to this, a significant amount of work was completed including:
1.  **Phase 1 (Foundation & DB Alignment) is complete at the backend level.** This involved:
    *   Updating  to add  (JSONB) and  columns, implement Row Level Security (RLS) for the  table, and create relevant database indices.
    *   Creating  for consistent  to  conversion for database interactions.
    *   Implementing new backend API endpoints: ,  for managing user progress, and  for checking AI service status.
    *   Attempting to integrate  into the main  handler (encountered lint errors but proceeded).
    *   Backend testing for Phase 1 endpoints was confirmed successful.
2.  **Transition to Phase 2 (AI Questions System) has begun.** This includes:
    *   Starting the implementation of the enhanced  endpoint to provide structured outputs (e.g., MCQ questions with specific schema, correct answers, explanations, and evidence quotes) while leveraging caching and respecting user quotas.
    *   Starting the development/update of the  component, intended to provide the UI for AI features within the RSVP Reader.
    *   A build error () was encountered and subsequently resolved by installing the missing  dependency.
The current immediate state is that the engineer has attempted to create/update  but encountered lint errors, and the next planned action is to install a missing select component which suggests further UI dependencies are needed for the AI tools panel.
